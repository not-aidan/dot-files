# Dot-Files

I use yadm (yet another dotfiles manager). I used to manage my dot files
manually with a .gitignore of "\*". Which makes it difficult to setup on a new
machine and to keep it maintained.

## Snippet to install
```
sudo apt install yadm & yadm clone https://github.com/not-aidan/dot-files.git & yadm status
```
